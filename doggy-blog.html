    <h3>Sleep is My Favorite</h3>
    <h4>January 21, 2016</h4>
    <p>I just wanted to let all my readers know that <strong>Sleep</strong> really is my <em>favorite</em> thing in the whole wide world. My bff Maggie tells me that it's more fun to Run and Jump and Bark in the yard, but I know better. She's younger than me, so I can understand why she hasn't realized the folly of her ways yet. Once you get to be 5 years old, though, you begin to understand why Sleep is better.</p>
    <p>I was about to start listing all the reasons that Sleep is better, but I'm getting tired. I'll have to let you know next time!</p>

    <h3>Loud Noises</h3>
    <h4>January 1, 2016</h4>
    <p>What is it with bipeds and loud noises in the night? I tried to settle in for my beauty rest yesterday evening and everything <em>seemed</em> like normal. Well, actually, the biped <em>did</em> seem peculiarly <strong>agitated</strong> about something. She kept looking at the clock and saying something about a ball dropping. I couldn't find the ball, but I did find myself '<em>dropping</em>' off to sleep! ;) <em>Get it!?!</em> =) Anyway, I'd <em>finally</em> settled in with my bff Maggie when I was awoken by lots of <strong>yelling</strong> and <strong>banging</strong> outside. I ran out to see what the problem was and saw all these <strong><em>explosions</em></strong> in the sky! I was convinced that the felines were finally invading and tried to let all the other Canines in the neighborhood know, but my biped got <em>really</em> angry and made me go inside. Apparently it's just something that bipeds do sometimes. I'll never understand them.</p>
    <p>In other news, I did manage to get an extra treat out of my biped tonight!</p>

    <h3>Life is Better with Friends</h3>
    <h4>December 27, 2015</h4>
    <p>The biped returned today. I was beginning to worry that she would not. She was gone for <em>at least</em> 3 days this time. She probably thought I wouldn't notice since she sent a replacement biped to feed me daily, but a Canine always knows. (The replacement smelled like <em>feline</em>, Yuck!) Luckily, I had my bff Maggie to keep me company.</p>
